Here I am using "random" module.....

random.random() -> generates a number between 0.0 to 1.0(but 1.0 exclusive)
random.randint(a,b)-> generates a number between a to b (both are included) 
random.uniform(a,b) -> generates a floating number between a to b
random.randrange(start, end,step) -> (0,10,2)-> (2,4,6,8)
